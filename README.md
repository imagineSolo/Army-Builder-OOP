# Army-Builder-OOP

Army-Builder is my idea for an OOP Javascript project. It's a strategic games inspired "app" for making your own medieval-era army.

Spend your points for units for your army. The unit space is limited to total 12 (including the general).

An idea for the future - a turn-based clash of two armies.
